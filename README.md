# Multiple-Checkboxes :ballot_box_with_check:

This project is part of the 30 day vanilla JavaScript coding challenge **JavaScript30** by Wes Bos.
The idea is to build 30 projects in 30 days. No Frameworks, no compilers, no libraries, no boilerplate, only pure JavaScript.

Check two checkboxes with the shift key down and all checkboxes in between will be checked automatically.
